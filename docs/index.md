    Perfect Media Server began life as a series of blog posts over at [blog.linuxserver.io](https://www.linuxserver.io/blog/tag:perfectmediaserver#blog_list):

## What is PMS? And what is this site for?

Perfect Media Server (PMS) isn't so much a "you must do things this way" type of deal, it's more like a set of principles and guidelines to help you build a similar solution. The software discussed here has worked very well for many years now and can completely replace Unraid, TrueNAS, or a Synology based setup.

By sharing the knowledge and thought patterns used to drive the decisions made here, you will leave armed with the ability to build your own DIY NAS, or as I like to call it, the Perfect Media Server.

That said, there are detailed instructions scattered throughout the site on many aspects of setting one up from scratch. Good luck, and have fun!
