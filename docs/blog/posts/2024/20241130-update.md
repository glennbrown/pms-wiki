A quick update post today. The X13SAE-F, Intel i5 13600k build has bedded in quite nicely over the last 6 months. Check out the full details over on the [example builds](../../01-overview/alexs-example-builds.md) for the exact hardware used.

Besides a minor hiccup with the way Intel handled [some QC issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVdmK1UGzGs), the chip has performed very well.

The biggest change this year has been a switch out to NixOS from Proxmox. In no small part this was enabled by building a separate virtualisation node based around the excellent Epyc chip - I made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91dp5l44X8A) about this.

NixOS has proven to be a really solid foundation for the media stack and uptime has never been higher thanks to the declarative configurations being self-documenting. And having a separate "playground" allowing me to treat the media server like "pseudo-production".

I continue to post regular videos over on [KTZ Systems](https://www.youtube.com/@ktzsystems) and the Self-Hosted podcast is still the highlight of my fortnight. Thanks to all of you who watch and/or listen.

Have a great 2025, and watch out for some more Perfect Media Server content coming to a channel near you.
